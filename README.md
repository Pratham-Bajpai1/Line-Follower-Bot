## Project Overview

The Line Follower Bot is an autonomous robot that follows a predefined line, typically a black line on a white surface or a white line on a black surface. It achieves this through the following basic operations:

- **Sensing:** The Digital IR Sensor Array installed on the front-down side of the robot reads the pre-defined line and sends the readings to the Arduino Uno.
- **Analysis:** The Arduino Uno analyzes the sensor readings and controls the movements of the robot accordingly.
- **Steering:** The robot's steering mechanism involves three wheels: two motorized wheels at the back and one independent wheel at the front-middle part of the robot.
